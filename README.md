The presented code is an implementation of an image carousel in pure JavaScript. It begins with the definition of an array of objects, where each object represents an image and contains an id and an image URL.

The code also selects an HTML element from the document with the id "container-items" and defines a "loadImages" function, which takes the image array and the container element as parameters. The function loads each image into the container with a "forEach" loop that creates a "div" element with the "item" class and an "img" element with the image URL.

After loading the images, the code selects all elements with the "item" class and defines two functions, "previous" and "next", which will be called when the navigation buttons are clicked. The "previous" function moves the first element to the end of the container, and the "next" function moves the last element to the beginning of the container.

Finally, the code adds event listeners to the "previous" and "next" navigation buttons and calls the corresponding functions when the buttons are clicked.
